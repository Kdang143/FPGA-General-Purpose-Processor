## **Complete ALU Circuit Diagram**

The purpose of problem is to procure input data and then represent them in the output of operations of
the ALU. A set of two 8-bit inputs, A and B, will contain the numbers 60 and 16. These numbers will
come from the last four digits of the student ID which means that A = (60) and B = (16) will translate
into binary output. To make sure that the ALU can continue to perform its arithmetical and logical
functions, the two 8-bit inputs will be stored in the latches that will be one of the primary inputs for 
ALU.
